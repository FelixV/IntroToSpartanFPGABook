Choosing your development board
--------------------------------

At the moment, I have six development boards.  They are all different-- one is little 
more than an FPGA on a PCB, another has DRAM, ROM and a large breadboard attached.  One 
thing I have learnt is that the more 'stuff' there is on the board to experiment with,
the more you will want to use it, and the more value you will get from it.

To keep costs down, I have selected two of the least expensive development boards as 
the reference for this book-- The Papilio One with the LogicStart MegaWing, and the Digilent
Basys2.  Although they both feature a Xilinx Spartan 3E FPGA they have very different 
design philosophies.

I really like the Gadget Factory boards, and Jack has been a big help supplying me with
prototypes and designing the LogicStart MegaWing specifically for this book.  If you are
going to acquire a board and have no reason to go either way, get the Papilio One.

All of the Papilio tools are open source and on GitHub, and the boards are really well
engineered-- I have been able to generate full HD VGA signals off of a Papilio board,
whereas I can't get a stable 640x480 signal from the Basys2.  

When all is said and done, both boards are great, and you won't be disappointed with either.
  
Why did I choose Xilinx FPGA, why not 'brand X'?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are currently two big players in the FPGA market - Xilinx and Altera.  Each 
vendor provides their own EDA tools and although they are talking the same 
language they are quite different (a bit like Eclipse vs Visual Studio).  I had
to pick one, and Xilinx's tool set is the most approachable.

If you are bold, you could work through this material with a different vendor's
development board, but it will be challenging at times.  It will be very much like
following a Visual C tutorial when running Eclipse.  Consider using that vendor's 
quick-start material for the first couple of projects then jump back in a few chapters on.

The one place where you will really struggle is with using the simulator.  The
configuration and setup of the simulation tools differs greatly between vendors, 
with the Altera solution being tricky to set up.

Papilio One + LogicStart MegaWing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Designed by Gadget Factory, the Papilio One board is squarely aimed at someone 
who has had previous experience with basic electronics, owns a soldering iron, 
and quite possibly has a few Arduino microcontrollers kicking around.  The 
Papilio One board holds the FPGA, a small serial ROM, a USB programming interface, 
and the required power supplies.  It provides direct access to 48 general purpose 
pins on the FPGA through six 8-bit 'Wing' connectors.  Originally envisioned as an
Arduino/FPGA hybrid, it is now used for projects such as software defined radio, 
emulating classic arcade games, and as a low cost way to experiment with FPGAs.

The Papilio One board ships with the headers used for attaching the wings, but 
they are not installed.  This gives you the added flexibility to embed the
board in your own projects and most probably saves a little on cost as it 
simplifies packaging.  When you solder on the headers, getting them aligned can 
be a challenge.  An easy way is to use some snap off pin header strips to form a jig, 
which will hold everything nice and square while you solder the headers in place.

The LogicStart MegaWing has been designed especially for people starting out with 
FPGAs, converting the Papilio One into something that matches the features and 
accessibility of the FPGA boards developed for the education market.  When mated 
with a Papilio One, it adds a few nice extras that will appeal to the Papilio One's 
target market, such as a small joystick, 8 channel ADC, and a 3.5mm audio jack.

Once you have outgrown the LogicStart MegaWing, Gadget Factory offers a range of 
other Wings that can be attached to the Papilio One to customize it to your 
future project's requirements, and it has an active community of helpful users 
on the forums hosted by Gadget Factory.  


Digilent Basys2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

image::boards/basys2.png[scaledwidth="75%"]

Digilent, Inc partners with Xilinx and designs and markets a range of FPGA 
development boards.  The Basys2 is their entry level board, targeted at the 
education market with phrases like "Build digital circuits for less than the 
price of a textbook!" in their marketing.  They offer pretty sharp Academic 
and US Student discounts, but there are quite a few hoops to jump through to 
qualify.

As the Basys2 has been used as the platform for course materials and textbooks, 
Digilent have far less freedom to add new features to the board-- for example, 
it still has a PS/2 port when no current PC ships with a PS/2 keyboard.  Diligent
also has an equivalent to Gadget Factory's 'Wing' system called 'PMOD'.  

The Basys2 comes in a DVD sized plastic case with foam padding, and includes a 
USB cable.  One feature of the Basys2 that is either a help or a hindrance, is 
that all externally available signals from the FPGA have resistors in series. 
This aids with ESD protection and helps to prevent damage from abuse in the
classroom environment, but can sometimes cause interfacing issues.

In my view the biggest flaw in the board is that Digilent have opted not to
use a crystal to generate a stable on-board clock-- possibly to save cost (or
maybe to remain compatible with the original Basys).  The jitter present in
its cheaper clock makes the Basys2 unsuitable for generating higher frequency 
signals-- for example, the VGA output is unusable for anything serious and most 
LCD monitors are unable to even sync with it!  There is a socket for a second 
clock signal, although the required part is expensive and hard to source.

NOTE: The part number in the BASYS2 reference manual is wrong-- order something
like _SGR-8002DC-PCC-ND_ from Digi-Key to provide a stable clock, should you require
one.

As I'm in New Zealand, I ordered mine from their ANZ distributor-- Black Box
Consulting.  They normally have everything in stock, so not only is it quicker than 
ordering from Digilent, the international shipping direct from Digilent is really, 
really, really expensive.  Why is it you can get a Papilio FPGA board from Seeed 
Studios for US$49.90 including postage, but it costs US$36.66 to ship a $99 order from 
Digilent? Black Box Consulting charged me a reasonable AU$10.00 for shipping.
